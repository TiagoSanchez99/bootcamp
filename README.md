## Functions

1. Given an array of Marvel characters, create a function that sorts them by release date.

2. Create a function that logs in the terminal numbers from 1 to 10 in a given interval. For example if the interval is 2000, it means that every 2s `console.log(1)` then `console.log(2)` and so on.
